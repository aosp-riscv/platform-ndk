# Android Native Development Kit (NDK)

The latest version of this document is available at
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/README.md.

**Note:** This document is for developers _of_ the NDK, not developers that use
the NDK.

The NDK allows Android application developers to include native code in their
Android application packages, compiled as JNI shared libraries.
